  {
    q: 'What is a consumer proposal?',
    a: 'A consumer proposal is a legally binding agreement between you and your creditors, administered by a Licensed Insolvency Trustee. It allows you to settle your unsecured debts for less than the full amount owed — often up to 80% less — with one affordable monthly payment over up to 5 years. No interest is charged on the remaining balance.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much of my debt can be reduced?',
    a: 'Many qualified clients reduce their unsecured debt by up to 80%. The exact amount depends on your income, assets, and the total debt owed. During your free consultation, we\'ll review your situation and give you a realistic estimate.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Will I lose my house or car?',
    a: 'In most cases, no. A consumer proposal typically allows you to keep your secured assets like your home and vehicle, as long as you continue making the regular payments on those secured debts. Unlike bankruptcy, a consumer proposal is specifically designed to protect your assets.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How quickly will collection calls stop?',
    a: 'Once your consumer proposal is filed, all unsecured creditors must immediately stop all collection activity. This means no more phone calls, letters, wage garnishments, or legal actions. This protection goes into effect the moment the proposal is filed — often within 24-48 hours of starting the process.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What debts are included in a consumer proposal?',
    a: 'Consumer proposals cover most unsecured debts including credit cards, personal loans, lines of credit, payday loans, income tax debt, and some student loans. Secured debts like mortgages and car loans are not included — you continue paying those separately.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does a consumer proposal take?',
    a: 'Consumer proposals run for a maximum of 5 years (60 months), but you can pay it off early at any time with no penalty. Once all payments are complete, the remaining unsecured debt is legally discharged and forgiven forever.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens to my credit score?',
    a: 'A consumer proposal does affect your credit score and will appear on your credit report. However, once your proposal is completed and discharged, you can begin rebuilding your credit. Many clients find that their credit score actually improves faster after a consumer proposal compared to continuing to struggle with unmanageable debt.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this the same as bankruptcy?',
    a: 'No — a consumer proposal is a significantly better alternative to bankruptcy for most people. Unlike bankruptcy, you keep your assets, your monthly payment is fixed, the process is more private, and the impact on your credit is typically less severe. We always explore whether a consumer proposal is an option before considering bankruptcy.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the consultation really free?',
    a: 'Yes, 100% free and with no obligation. We will review your full financial situation, explain all your options, and give you an honest recommendation — at no cost and no pressure to proceed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I get started?',
    a: 'Simply call us at 587-892-1200 or fill out our online form. We\'ll schedule a free consultation and walk you through everything step by step.',
